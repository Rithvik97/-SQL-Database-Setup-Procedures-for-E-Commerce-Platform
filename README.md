## Conceptual ERD 

This conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the database schema for a retail system. It depicts the relationships between entities like 'Product', 'Category', 'Inventory', and 'Warehouse', which are involved in the stocking and categorization of items. 'Seller' and 'Consumer' entities represent the users of the system, detailing their personal information and their interactions through 'Purchase' and 'Shipping' entities. The 'Shipping' entity is further linked to 'Shipping_Speed', indicating the system can track the speed or type of delivery for purchases. This ERD is typical for e-commerce systems, where various entities must interact cohesively to manage inventory, process sales, and handle shipping logistics.

## Logical ERD

The logical ERD outlines the data model of an e-commerce or retail management system, highlighting the relationships between its main entities: 'Category', 'Product', 'Inventory', 'Warehouse', 'Seller', 'Consumer', 'Purchase', 'Shipping', and 'Shipping_Speed'. Each entity is defined by primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) that establish the relational structure, such as products being linked to categories, inventory items to products and warehouses, and purchases connecting consumers, inventory, and shipping details. The ERD serves as a blueprint for the database design, ensuring that the system can effectively manage product listings, inventory tracking, sales processes, and the delivery of items, with the inclusion of shipping speed options.

## Database Schema


### Tables

- **Seller**: Contains details about the sellers on the platform.
- **Category**: Defines various product categories.
- **Product**: Stores products, including details like name, description, price, category, and the seller.
- **Consumer**: Holds consumer information.
- **Warehouse**: Lists warehouses where products are stored.
- **Inventory**: Manages stock levels of products in various warehouses.
- **Purchase**: Records purchases made by consumers.
- **Shipping_Speed**: Defines different shipping speeds available.
- **Shipping**: Tracks the shipping status of purchases.

### Sequences

- **inventory_id_seq**: Used to generate unique IDs for inventory items.

  ```sql
  CREATE SEQUENCE inventory_id_seq  
    START WITH 1  
    INCREMENT BY 1;
  
- **product_seq**: Used to generate unique IDs for products.

  ```sql
  CREATE SEQUENCE product_seq  
    START WITH 1  
    INCREMENT BY 1;

## Procedures

### Product Management

- **newproduct**: Adds a new product to the database, assigning it a unique product ID from `product_seq`.

```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE newproduct (   
      p_product_name IN VARCHAR,   
      p_description IN VARCHAR,   
      p_product_price IN DECIMAL,   
      p_category_id IN NUMBER,   
      p_seller_id IN NUMBER)  
  IS   
    v_product_id NUMBER;  
  BEGIN  
  SELECT product_seq.NEXTVAL INTO v_product_id FROM dual;  
	  INSERT INTO product (product_id, product_name, product_description, product_price, category_id, seller_id)  
	  VALUES (v_product_id, p_product_name, p_description, p_product_price, p_category_id, p_seller_id);  
	  COMMIT;  
  END;
```
### Inventory Management

- **receive_product**: Records the reception of products into the inventory, assigning a unique inventory ID from `inventory_id_seq`.

```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE receive_product ( 
      p_product_quantity IN NUMBER, 
      p_product_name IN VARCHAR2, 
      p_seller_id IN NUMBER, 
      p_product_id IN NUMBER, 
      p_warehouse_id IN NUMBER) 
  IS 
  BEGIN 
      INSERT INTO Inventory (inventory_id, product_quantity, product_name, seller_id, product_id, warehouse_id) 
      VALUES (inventory_id_seq.NEXTVAL, p_product_quantity, p_product_name, p_seller_id, p_product_id, p_warehouse_id); 
      COMMIT; 
  END;
  /
```

### Consumer Management

- **add_new_consumer**: Adds a new consumer to the database.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_new_consumer ( 
    p_consumer_id IN INT, 
    p_first_name IN VARCHAR2, 
    p_last_name IN VARCHAR2, 
    p_email IN VARCHAR2, 
    p_phone_number IN VARCHAR2, 
    p_address IN VARCHAR2 
) 
AS

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE purchase_product( 
    purchase_id IN INT,  
    p_quantity IN INT,  
    consumer_id IN INT,  
    inventory_id IN INT

IS 
BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO Purchase (purchase_id, p_quantity, consumer_id, inventory_id) 
    VALUES (purchase_id, p_quantity, consumer_id, inventory_id); 
END; 

/
```
### Shipping Management
- **ship_order**: Records the shipping of an order, marking it with a status (e.g., 'Shipped').

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE ship_order(
    p_shipping_id IN INT, 
    p_status IN VARCHAR2, 
    p_purchase_id IN INT,
    p_speed_id IN INT) AS
